Go to the Network Pane of System Preferences

Open Safari and navigate to a both an internal and external site
For internal, I would suggest a page that requests authentication, such as a TE Sharepoint site, like the MyTE portal or Mac@Work site.
For external, I would suggest attempting a search using a major search engine like Bing or Google.

You should be prompted for authentication to the proxy environment, enter your TE credentials.

Once the Sharepoint page loads completely, quit Safari and launch TEMPO 2.0

Before returning the device to regular operation, you should change the location setting in System Preferences back to its previous selection.
